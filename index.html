                <p class="section_cover_letter_text">My name is Calin Gilan, I am currently a Software Engineer at Capital One. 
                    I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University. 
                    Since a child, I’ve always had a strong interest in computers and art. 
                    While the fundamentals of Computer Science are grounded in math, 
                    I believe that developing good software requires a healthy dose of creativity.
                </p>
                <p class="section_cover_letter_text">
                    My skills are Primarily in Java and Golang, as well as a strong base in C. 
                    I believe in treating languages as a tool to achieve a goal or vision, 
                    rather than something you have to label yourself with. Because of this, 
                    I pride myself in having a fast ramp up time with new languages.
                </p>
                <p class="section_cover_letter_text">
                    I also realize that being a strong engineer means developing skills outside my discipline. 
                    I have strong documentation skills, a willingness to help people my junior, 
                    and strong social skills. Outside work, 
                    I make sure I make sure to keep up with my personal hobbies that I enjoy outside software.
